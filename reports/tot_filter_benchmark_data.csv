0,5_files,102.73,97.02,95,421,9.60,1.92,34.3,16.1,Use only for specialized low-energy studies
1,5_files,116.63,100.86,88,419,9.60,1.92,52.4,16.1,NEVER USE - worst performance with no benefits
2,5_files,79.54,73.86,94,418,8.89,1.78,4.0,7.5,Good compromise for sensitivity studies
3,5_files,76.52,68.98,92,414,8.27,1.65,0.0,0.0,RECOMMENDED - best overall (fastest and smallest)
0,50_files,,,,,95,1.94,,,Available for large-scale studies
1,50_files,1159.08,1072.62,93,420,95,1.94,51.6,29.6,NEVER USE - confirmed worst at scale
2,50_files,847.37,788.14,93,430,88,1.80,10.8,19.8,Good balance - faster than TOT=1
3,50_files,765.00,,,135,2.76,0.0,0.0,RECOMMENDED - best overall at scale
