# Scripts

## Repo management
`manage-submodules.sh` - Script to manage submodules in a repository. It can be used to add, update, remove, and list submodules. 
You should only need to run 

```bash
./manage-submodules.sh --up
```
the first time you install it ot when you want to reinitialize, but you can see the other options by running ```./manage-submodules.sh -h```.


## Data processing

### `superimpose_signal_and_backgrounds.sh`

This is used in order to superimpose the backgrounds to the data. 
This is in order to avoid having a huge background sample while our tracks just take a very tiny portion of the space.
